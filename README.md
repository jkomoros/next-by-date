# Next File

Next File is a plugin for Obsidian that allows you to navigate to the next or previous file within the current folder, by file creation date.

## Features
This plugin adds two commands, which you can run from the command pane or by assigning a hotkey. Both commands operate relative to the active pane's current file.
- **Next Created - Navigate to next file in current folder by file creation date** - (Default: ⌘⎇↓) Navigates to the next file in the current folder, comparing files based on creation time.
- **Previous Created - Navigate to previous file in current folder by file creation date** - (Default: ⌘⎇↑) Navigates to the previous file in the current folder, comparing files based on creation time.
- **Next Modified - Navigate to next file in current folder by file modification date** - (Default: ⌘⎇↓) Navigates to the next file in the current folder, comparing files based on modification time.
- **Previous Modified - Navigate to previous file in current folder by file modification date** - (Default: ⌘⎇↑) Navigates to the previous file in the current folder, comparing files based on modification time.
